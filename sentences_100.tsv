2	E.O. 12958: DECL: declassified by Nara 09/02/2009 Tags: EFIS, PBTs, AR subject:  extended National jurisdictions over high seas  ref: state 106206 circular; state CA-3400 Nov 2, 1966   1.  press reports and variety embassy sources confirm New Argentine legislation unilaterally changing seas JURIS- diction now under advanced review.
3	Reportedly law would establish six mile territorial Sea, plus another six miles of exclusive fishing jurisdiction, plus another extended zone of "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" for fishing purposes.
4	Draft- law under consideration in Argentine Senate before June 28 coup would have defined zone of preferential jurisdiction as "EPICONTINENTAL sea out to 200 meter ISOBAR".
5	In southern Argentina this zone several hundred miles wide and blankets Falkland Islands.
6	2.  NAVATT States Argentine Navy thinking of preferential jurisdiction out to 200 miles (as in Peru, Ecuador, Chile) rather than epicontinental sea.
7	200 mile limit does not RPT not reach Falklands.
8	Argentine Navy off told NAVATT "200 mile limit soon will be standard through Hemisphere".
9	3.  FONOFF officials referring to recent Brazilian and US legislation have informally indicated decision already final Re six mile territorial sea plus six mile exclusive fishing jurisdiction, but that "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" still under study.
10	Two FONOFF men voluntarily and informally sought embassy reaction to possible extended preferential jurisdiction by suggesting that US in fact has accepted unilaterally created Ecuadorian, Peruvian and Chilean 200 mile limits.
11	Emboff rejected idea US accepts these limits in any way and pointed out 1965 amendments to aid legislation aimed at further protecting US fishing rights.
12	4.  FONOFF legal advisor concedes distinction between "EXCLUSIVE" and "PREFERENTIAL" fishing jurisdiction a semantic nicety.
13	He understands that in zone of "PREFERENTIAL"
14	JURIS- diction Argentina would claim right to tax, license and other- wise control all activities related to exploitation of resources of sea.
15	5.  draft legislation on seas jurisdiction lay dormant until sudden and substantial in Fishin Argentine epicontinental seas by Cuban and East European (especially Soviet) vessels past six months alarmed Argentine armed forces.
16	(see NAVATT IR 5-804-0-140-66 of Nov 18) not RPT not all Soviet vessels were fishing or factory types.
17	FONOFF sources informally state armed forces pressure makes emission New law imperative, quite possibly appearing within next few weeks.
18	When asked by FONOFF men about "Security problems created by Soviet trawlers off US Coast"
19	, embassy off replied US did not RPT not see that unilateral attempt to extend seas jurisdiction offered any realistic solution for possible security problems, while such action could create New sources possible misunderstanding and conflict.
20	6.  Re par 3 state 106206 believe outlined proposal might forestall unilateral Argentine attempt to substantially extend "PREFERENTIAL" fishing jurisdiction only if embassy can be authorized discuss idea with Argentines immediately.
21	Even then chances success limited by (a) advanced stage proposed Argentine law and (b) primacy security considerations Argentine thinking. we would benefit some from FONOFF legal Advisors' qualms about unilateral action, and from restraint of recent Brazilian legislation which did not RPT not go beyond 12-mile limit.
22	7.  for discussion with Argentines would modify text in state 10942 circular to:  (a) make all References to Argentina, vice Canada; (b) refer to proposed Argentine claims of preferential jurisdiction over waters we regard as high seas; (C) eliminate References to "Traditional distant water fisheries", since Argentine Coast not RPT not traditional fishing zone (whereas No. 3);  (D) add notation there no traditional fishing and confine operative agreement to provisions for non-traditional fishing; (e) eliminate last three pars of aide-memoire handed to Canadian Amb.
23	8.  if authorized, envisage two-step approach to FONOFF.
24	First, informal and oral, stressing our interest in freedom of high seas, noting earlier FONOFF confirmation New law under study, outlining our proposal in general terms.  on basis FONOFF reaction, we would then couch aide-memoire in terms which would appear most likely to succeed.

27	Unclassified section 01 of 01 Tehran 1164  E.O. 12958: as amended; declassified June 21, 2006 Tags: mass, Marr, IR subject: acceleration of F-4Es for Iran  ref: Tehran 1091: Tehran 263: Moscow 1603  country team.
28	Message   begin summary  general Azimi, Minister of war, on instruction of Shah asks that we take another hard look at F-4E production line in order accelerate delivery of one Squadron of F-4Es to Iran in 1972. request reflects Shah's increasing concern over Soviet ambitions in area and especially threat Shah sees to Iran of friendship treaty under consideration by Iraq and USSR. Shah recognizes problems this poses for US but is turning to USG with this request to give Iran higher priority on FA-4E production schedule because he regards US as most dependable friend.
29	End summary  action requested: country team recommends US review F-4E production line and respond favorably to Shah's request for 16 F-4Es in 1972 from whatever source may be available.
30	1. on Feb 24 charge was convoked by Minster of war, Gen.
31	REZANUZIMI, on instructions from Shah.
32	Azimi said Shah most deeply concerned at trends in security situation in middle East and expecially on his Western borders.
33	US officals already aware of Shah's concern through discussions with foreign Minister and other GOI officials (see REFTELS), but recent developments in Iraq Soviet relations including agreement to deliver more MiGs and other military equipment plus indication that recent Iraqi-Soviet talks in Moscow included consideration of friendship treaty as well as increased military cooperation inject New sense of urgency in Shah's timetable for MODERNINZING and strenthening his armed forces.
34	Most Specifically, situation required Iran accelerate its military procurement and host particularly delivery of F-4E aircraft.
35	2. Azimi recalled that GOI had requested delivery of 16 of F-4E aircraft now on order by Iran (first of which was not scheduled for delivery until August 1973) be advanced to Cy 1972.
36	However, GOI had recently been informed by USG and McDonnell-Douglas that production line for Iran could not RPT not be advanced to meet 1972 delivery dates desired.
37	Shah was most disturbed, as addition of F-4Es in 1972 was vital to Iran's security at this time.
38	Shah had directed that USG be asked, if production for Iran could not in fact be advanced, to make requested F-4Es available from other sources.
39	Shah's desire is for DELIIVERY of F-4Fs in lots of four during June to December time-frame.
40	3. charge reviewed recent developments in US-Iran military cooperation, including equipment and credit, and stressed that record indicated we understood and appreciated Shah's concerns and desires and had been exceptionally responsive to Shah's wishes.
41	Currently, Azimi's deputy Gen.
42	TOUFANS, was in US discussing very question of acclerated equipment ACQUISIION including F-4E. acceleration of F-4E delivery raised difficult technical and cost problems as well as questions of other commitments and priorities. undoubtedly these issues were being discussed in full with Gen.
43	Toufanian to ensure that he was completely informed of possibilities and problems and reasons for any limitations on meeting GOI request that might exist.
44	Gen.
45	Toufanian probably would have Fuller picture of situation than we now had in Iran.
46	4. Azimi responded that GOI was being kept informed of Toufanian discussions, but decison on F-4E could not be delayed.
47	Azimi made clear Shah felt aquisition of 16 F-4E aircraft in 1972 was most important immediate military problem outstanding.
48	He stressed Shah believed that number required was small in relation to US inventory, and that unsettled situation confronting Iran warranted accelerated delivery to Iran as against other possible dispositions (as to Europe or even USAF) in same time frame.
49	5. charge noted we would transmit Shahs request to, Washington and that USG in spirit of friendship which marked our relations would make every effort to be responsive. charge said this same friendship required him to say, However, that Although we would do everything possible to meet Shah's needs as Shah saw them, our military advisers, as GOI knew, were concerned that acceleration of aircraft acquisition would strain support and operational manpower of IIAF and could lead to decrease rather than increase in IIAF effectiveness.
50	Azimi replied that number of aircraft to be delivered had been, closely studied by ILAF with Maag assistance, and IIAF was satisfied that sixteen aircraft requested could be effectively integrated into present force structure.
51	Azimi closed meeting by asking that USG answer Shah's request as rapidly as possible.
52	6. comment.
53	Shah is deeply concern at developments over past years strengthening Soviet influence and presence in Mideast and Indian Ocean and appearing to indicate substantially enlarged Soviet commitment, economic and military, to Iraq.
54	He has concluded that increased present danger reqires Iran's first line Air defense to be beefed-up now rather than in previously programmed schedule starting in eighteen months.
55	The number, frequency and tone of demarches on subject we have received is virtually unparallelled, and can leave no doubt that him considers issue of vital importance.
56	7. whether we fully agree with Shah's concern, we must take into account that request --like USG decision in 1970 on sale to Iran of seventh and eighth squadrons of F-4E --Has become another gut issue in Shah's mind.
57	Shah is again turning to USG because in periods of anxiety Shah feels he can look to US for cooperation and he hopes that US as reliable friend will find chance be responsive on matter he considers important and vital to Iran's security.
58	Thus USG consideration of request must recognize that decision involves unusual degree of political importance related to fabric of USG-GOI relations. decision should also not overlook or underestimate importance of Iran for vital US National interests.
59	8. action requested. counry team urges that USG give prompt and sympathetic attention to Shah's request for 1972 delivery of F-4E aircraft, from whatever sources may be available to be tapped (including deliveries to USAF). we recognize that request may raise difficult problems, but urge that every Avenue be explored to reach positive response. it is also most important that country team be kept fully informed of progress and prospects to enable US continue to meet and temper sense of urgency on subject which prevails within GOI. if delays or barriers to fully favorable response materialize, we trust that every effort will be made to be as forthcoming as possible (e.g. partial delivery in 1972) and that persuasive rationale can be developed to fully explain to Shah reasons for any shortcoming. in order to diminish as much as possible negative impact.

61	Unclassified section 01 of 01 Tehran 1381  E.O. 12958: as amended; declassified June 21, 2006 Tags: Prel, PGOV, IR subject: TRIALS/EXECUTIONS of anti-government elements: students demonstrate and Shah lashes out at foreign critics
62	1. in protest against recent TRIALS/PUNISHMENT (particularly executions, which now total 10) of ANTI-GOVERNMENT-ELEMENTS, Tehran University students -- lead by faculty of engineering students-- mounted on-campus demonstration afternoon of March 7 and even large one (Circ 600) morning of March 8. while University administration felt capable of handling March 7 demonstration without help of outside police, they apparently felt unable do so March 8 and called National police onto campus for brief period.
63	Result was much manhandling of students but there are no reports of any serious CASUALTIES/CLASHES, and University was quiet by early afternoon.
64	2. some faculties at other Tehran universities (e.g.
65	Aryamehr, National and Polytechnic) are reported to have engaged in sympathy STRIKES"
66	March 8 but so far no demonstrations reported* there is reliable report that demonstrations by students at University of meshed (six of 10 executed came from meshed area) became serious enough that University was closed three days ago and still remains closed.
67	(Comment: we would not be surprised if GOI orders Tehran universities closed until after no Ruz holiday.)
68	3. from comments of students and observers close to academic circles, it seems clear large part of motivation for demonstration and sympathy strikes  is student anger over Goi's continued detention of several students as "ANTI-STATE" subversives and, even more, anger over recent trials and executions of those convicted of anti-state activities.
69	There are already indications, However, that GOI considers timing of demonstrations (perhaps demonstrations themselves) promoted by anti-state elements to embarrass GOI during visit of Chancellor Brandt and his considerable press retinue.
70	4. in related development, which might well have been intended for ears of student demonstrators and their sympathizers Shah lashed out strongly in March 7 press conference (with German PRESSMEN) at what he labelled distorted foreign reporting about trials and executions.
71	Him hit at Le Monde vigorously and repeatedly, and took particular exception to Le Monde's appeal for clemency for those convicted in recent trials.
72	After asking two rhetorical questions "has Le Monde ever asked whether these murderers have right to take lives of innocent people?
73	Has Le Monde ever written one word of condemnation against terrorists and assassins sent by IRA to exterminate PEOPLE?")
74	, Shah said foreign press has no right give advice on matters they know nothing about.
75	He recalled his "Constitutional DUTY" not to permit "Terror or attempts against my country's sovereignty and territorial integrity by agents of other countries."
76	Exempt  heck
77	Unclassified Tehran 4789  E.O. 12958: as amended; declassified June 21, 2006 Tags: IR, Pter subject: continuing terrorist activities in Iran  ref: Tehran's A-077 of may 15, 1972: Tehran 3312  Summary: terrorist activities in Iran seem to be increasing instead of usual summer subsidence due to vacation for students, perhaps indicating better organization and broadening of appeal to non-student groups.
78	Vigorous anti-guerrilla campaign on part of Iranian security organizations is netting numbers of individuals but harsh GOI policy apparently unable bring guerrillas under control and may in fact be hardening attitudes of guerrillas and their sympathizers.
79	While terrorist groups not yet threat to regime, GOI unlikely succeed in halting their activities without first addressing basic question of political, social and administrative reforms.
80	End summary
81	1. despite continuing large-scale campaign on part of GOI security organs, urban guerrillas are maintaining rate of activity. during past four month period there have been 28 confirmed explosions (11 of which directed against US presence), ten shootouts and several other incidents including unsuccessful attempt to kidnap daughter of court Minister Alam, and plot to sabotage Isfahan steel mill. other unconfirmed incidents reported on almost daily basis.
82	2. Iranian security organs, including SAVAEEEAAA Gendarmerie and local police, reacting vigorously and with heavy hand. during same period at least 16 guerrillas killed in confrontations with authorities, 13 others announced executed, ten sentenced to death but reprieved and sentence to life in prison, nine others given life, and 39 convicted and given sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years.
83	All of above tried by military tribunals, and Majles has recently passed law providing specifically that all those engaging in acts of sabotage will be tried by military courts with possible sentences ranging from one year to death.
84	GOI has committed considerable resources to so far unsuccessful attempt to control TERRORISTS--FOR example, two of officers normally detailed to work with BNDD agents on narcotics matters have been reassigned to guerrilla problem.
85	3. it is widely believed in Tehran that urban guerrilla activity is increasing and it is certain that a greater number of incidents are being reported in the controlled local media. but increased RAPPORTAGE, which may result as much from reputed pressure from local pressmen on GOI as from continuing government desire to exploit less savory aspects of guerrilla operations does not cover all incidents independently confirmed by embassy let alone the many guerrilla activity which are rumored but not confirmed.
86	Moreover frequency of unconfirmed incidents has increased by a factor at least as great as that of those given media coverage, leading to presumption that stepped up terrorist activity is a reality and not a result of inspired publicity. perhaps more significant than increased guerrilla activity is fact that high level of incidents has continued into summer when students, who have in past provided bulk of recruits for guerrillas, dispersed for vacations.
87	This may mean that underground movements are becoming better organized and are catching on with non-student groups, which if true, would heighten difficulty of penetrating and controlling guerrilla groups.
88	4. despite GOI apparent inability to suppress guerrillas, embassy continues to believe that terrorists at present constitue an irritant and EMRARRASSMENT but pose no threat to regime.
89	However, it is apparent to us, again very tentatively, that GOI tactics of harsh repression against guerrillas are not working very well and may provoke snowball effect of action and reaction part of SAVAK terrorists, leading to broadening resentment among populace against SAVAK pervasiveness and tactics.
90	Eventually regime will have to implement programs responsive to at least some of the political, economic and social complaints which form bases of guerrilla dissatisfaction. we do not ENUMMERATE these complaints here, partially because they are not completely formed and defined in our own minds or even, perhaps in the minds of the terrorists themselves.
91	Moreover, terrorist movement is not ideologically or organizationally unified and nature of their complaints varies from group to group.
92	We shall be examining further and reporting on these and other aspects of the guerrilla movement.
93	Meanwhile, without sounding any alarm bells, this message is intended to alert the Department that the urban guerrilla movement in Iran continues to be a fact of local political life which Bears continuing scrutiny.
94	5. the U.S. presence in Iran, while targeted by the terrorists, is not their primary target and some sort of incentive such as President Nixon's may visit (see REFTEL) or the January SAVAK TV show which precede last spring's show trials has been necessary to bring on bombings at American installations. we are continuing all reasonable security precautions.

96	Unclassified Tehran 5055  E.O. 12958: as amended; declassified June 21, 2006 Tags: IR, Pter subject: continuing terrorist violence  ref: Tehran 4887  Summary: following assassination of general said Taheri, bombing and other terrorist activities have continued to increase.
97	SAVAK maintaining its policy of widespread preventive arrests and, while this runs risk of heightening resentment among populace, officials seem confident that guerrillas are on the run. we are skeptical about the official optimism and feel that sanguine public statements and the guerrilla reaction they usually provoke may further erode credibility of security organs in mind of public. end summary
98	1. in wake of smoothly handled assassination August 13 of head of prisons Brigadier general said Taheri (REFTEL) who was also chief of an anti-guerrilla subcommittee with responsibility for University students, frequency of terrorist activities has increased.
99	Recent confirmed incidents have included a bomb in a Tehran Department store which injured the terrorist planting it, bomb in Tehran National Iranian oil company building which killed watchman, apprehension of a terrorist in South Tehran which resulted in one killed and five wounded, and shooting to death of three policemen in a small Bazaar in South Tehran. numerous other bombings and shootings rumored but not verified by embassy or confirmed by GOI.
